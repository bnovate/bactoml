Welcome to BactoML's documentation!
===================================

This library provides efficient solutions to load, manage and process large FCS dataset.

It implements solutions to integrate FlowCytometryTools library FCMeasurement with 
sk-learn compatible Pipeline making it easy to create complex branched processing 
pipeline for your datasets.

It also implements a graph based algorithm for detection of outlier FCS files as well 
as solutions to generate artificial dataset by mixing reference datasets.
